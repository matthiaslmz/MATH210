#Project2 from MATH210

There has been heat/talk about student debt and the ever increasing tuition fee. Akin to age, tuition fee for university only increases. The aim of this project is to understand the history of university tuition fee in Canada and see the changes in tuition fee since 1972.

In particular, we will only be exploring average domestic undergraduates tuition fee in Canada.

- For the first part of the project, we will analyze the data down, find any anomalies and explain them in order to understand the history of undergraduate tuition fee in Canada.

- As for the second part, we will attempt to find out how much more/less are we paying for tuition compared to about three decades ago.
